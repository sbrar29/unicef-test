# Task 2: Data Perspective - Evolution of Education for 4- to 5-Year-Old Children

## Introduction

Early childhood development is multidimensional and encompasses several aspects of a child's well-being, including physical growth, literacy and numeracy skills, socio-emotional development and readiness to learn. These four domains are vital to a childâ€™s overall development and build the foundation for later life, setting the trajectory for health, learning
and well-being. This current analysis seeks to better understand how educational performance among 4- to 5-year-old children in Zimbabwe evolves month by month at these critical ages. The following development domains were assessed by the child's age in months: Literacy & Math, Physical, Learning, and Socio-emotional. Data was utilized from the 2019 Zimbabwe MICS6 survey, focusing on children aged 3 and 4 years.

## Methodology

The analysis focuses on four key domains:
- **Literacy & Math** (EC6, EC7, EC8): Children are identified as being developmentally on track based on whether they can identify/name at least ten letters of the alphabet, whether they can read at least four simple, popular words, and whether they know the name and recognize the symbols of all numbers from 1 to 10. If at least two of these are true, then the child is considered developmentally on track.
- **Physical** (EC9, reverse-coded EC10): If the child can pick up a small object with two fingers, like a stick or a rock from the ground and/or the mother/caretaker does not indicate that the child is sometimes too sick to play, then the child is regarded as being developmentally on track in the physical domain.
- **Learning** (EC11, EC12): If the child follows simple directions on how to do something correctly and/or when given something to do, is able to do it independently, then the child is considered to be developmentally on track in this domain.
- **Socio-emotional** (EC13, reverse-coded EC14, reverse-coded EC15): Children are considered to be developmentally on track if two of the following are true: If the child gets along well with other children, if the child does not kick, bite, or hit other children and if the child does not get distracted easily.

Each domain was represented by a composite score, calculated by assessing whether children met the necessary criteria for each domain.
ECDI-10 is then calculated as the percentage of children who are developmentally on track in at least three of these four domains.
